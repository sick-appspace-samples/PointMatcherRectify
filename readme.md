## PointMatcherRectify
Matching objects using PointMatcher and rectifying image to render object always in same perspective, size and position.
### Description
This Sample is teaching visually significant points on the teach object and using those to find identical objects, which may also contain changes in size and out-of-plane rotation.  All found objects are rectified such that they appear flat, unrotated and always at the same position and size, regardless of their actual positions in the input images.
### How to Run
Starting this sample is possible either by running the App (F5) or debugging (F7+F10). Setting breakpoint on the first row inside the 'main' function allows debugging step-by-step after 'Engine.OnStarted' event. Results can be seen in the image viewer on the DevicePage. Restarting the Sample may be necessary to show images after loading the web-page. To run this Sample a device with SICK Algorithm API and AppEngine >= V2.8.0 is required. For example SIM4000 with latest firmware. Alternatively the Emulator in AppStudio 2.3 or higher can be used.
